title: Twenty Something

I recently came across a story on Instagram that really resonated. It is an excerpt from a larger [piece](https://nicoles.substack.com/p/am-i-wasting-my-20s) by Nicole. And it goes like; 

```python
"""
Being 20 something in a big city is both agony 
and bliss. Everyone is lonely, everyone is
obsessed, everyone is hungry. A collective era
of being lost, hopeful, and distracted. Being 
overwhelmed with options, feeling unsure
about choices. Feeling like everything matters
and nothing matters at all. 

Your 20s is probably the only time in your life 
you have the specific, glorious combination of 
agency and few commitments. 

You could theoretically change your life at any
moment. Move here, date that person, work on
that startup, write that blog, dye your hair, 
adopt a dog. Of course it's never easy â€“ but
it's possible to uproot yourself, become a new 
person. Should I stay, should I go? I don't know
if this agency is freedom or burden. Perhaps all
the best things are both.

Being 22 and living and working in London, I have never related more to a piece of writing. I would probably write something more on this topic at a later time.
