I find beauty in a process done right. Itâ€™s the elegance born from the structure of making good decisions and executing with professionalism. This focus transforms the mundane into the meaningful. A well-structured argument, a clean line of code, or a flawlessly managed project all possess this aesthetic quality. They are symphonies of small, correct choices, proving that beauty is the natural byproduct of competence.

And yet, I know this is not the end.

One day I will be a modernist.
