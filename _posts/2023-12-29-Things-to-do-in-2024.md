title: What do I want to do more of in 2024?

Recently, I shared a questions sticker on my instagram page, for friends and acquaintances to ask random questions. Typically I do this as a form of low effort social media engagement, mostly to share memes and proffer mildly witty responses to questions asked, for my own amusement, as well as those who share my fairly extensive (If I do say so myself!) meme sense of humour. 

Most of the questions I received ended up fitting this theme, as people were playful with the questions. But occasionally there were some more thought provoking questions. In this case one person asked; 

> "What are some things I would like to do more of in 2024?".

Someone had asked a somewhat similar question earlier already but I had tried avoiding providing an answer as it felt invasive and did not fit the theme of the entire exercise, but on getting asked the second time, I gave a glossy reply, saying;

> Health, wealth, love and self expression matter to me. So I want to do more things that get me in a better place across these dimensions. 

I replied further and said 

* I want to write more and possibly model (Self Expression).

* I need to pick up new skills before Chat Jibiti (GPT) makes me obsolete (Wealth).

* I need to get in better shape (Health).

* I need to do something with love (IDK yet)

Considering it is the year's end, I thought I would deepen my introspection on here (It's a blog after all). So, let's ditch the filters and delve into the four pillars that hold up my 2024 vision: health, wealth, love, and self-expression.
 
## [](#header-2)Why are these Important? 
**_Health, wealth, Love and self expression_**. Why do I think these are important to me? I think the answer is fairly obvious since these are not unique desires in any form, but I might have a different perspective so here goes; 

* **Health (More Than Just Biceps)**: 
  Just last week I had to go to the clinic to treat an ear infection. I had just come back from a trip so I was very paranoid that I had picked up something bad, and did not have the patience for the UK healthcare system, so I decided to visit a private clinic. This visit cost me a whooping £350 which is ridiculous to say the least (I did not know it would cost this much scream). 

  Being in a foreign country, and having lived in multiple countries before this, a huge part of my peace of mind comes from knowing that I am in good shape. And while physical fitness is crucial, mental well-being deserves equal billing. As someone who tends to self-isolate, mastering healthy stress management is key. Whether it's mindfulness mantras, nature walks, or ditching those late-night scrolling sessions that leave me drained and gym-averse, prioritizing my mental health is an investment in all other aspects of my life.

* **Wealth (Freedom, Not Just Flights)**:
  Wealth, for me, doesn't just mean zeros in a bank account (it also means nines before the zeros). It's about security, independence, and the freedom to pursue fulfilling endeavors without financial shackles. Building good financial habits isn't a glamorous pursuit, but I have quickly learnt that it's the key to unlocking time, job satisfaction, and the ability to invest in experiences that truly matter. 
  
  My 2024 wealth quest is all about conscious spending, smart budgeting, and even learning a new skill to boost my earning potential. Chat Jibiti might be coming for our jobs, but hey, a diversified skillset never hurts, right?

* **Love (Rom-Com Clichés)**:
  Love, in my book, is a multi-dimensional masterpiece. Self-love takes center stage – it's about embracing my quirks, appreciating my strengths, and nurturing my own well-being. But love also craves connection – deeper, more intentional relationships with friends, family, and maybe even a special someone (wink wink). 
  
  I might be low-maintenance, but beneath the chill exterior lies a yearning for genuine connections. That's why cultivating a strong support system, one that can weather health challenges, financial goals, and even my awkward attempts at self-expression, is a priority.

* **Self Expression (Beyond the jokes)**:
  For me, self-expression isn't just about flaunting my meme-worthy humor (although, let's be honest, that's part of the charm). It's also about stepping outside my comfort zone, sharing my unique perspective, and connecting with like-minded souls. 
  
  Writing, maybe even some light modeling (gasp!), anything that lets me shed the inhibitions and embrace my authentic self is fair game. But it's also not just about outward expression; it's also about establishing clear boundaries. No more suffering in silence! Learning to say "no" and expressing my needs is a crucial step towards a more empowered and self-assured me.

## [](#header-2) Challenges and Obstacles (As with all good things...)
This isn't just a wish list; it's a roadmap with plenty of potential potholes. Vulnerability, for a joker like me, can feel like a tightrope walk. Finding the balance between putting myself out there and staying in control of my narrative will be a delicate dance. And boundaries? Let's face it, setting them can be awkward, even conflict-inducing. My anti-confrontational tendencies won't make things easier, but hey, growth rarely happens in the comfort zone, right?

But it's nice to commit to growth. If anything it's my greatest strength. So, this is my 2024 mission statement – a journey **_towards_** healthier living, financial freedom, deeper connections, and unapologetic self-expression. At the very least, there'll be a few well-placed memes along the way.

Ultimately, Here's to hoping for a fun year ahead!
