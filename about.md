Hi there, I'm Oluwarotimi and I generally enjoy putting down my thoughts! Welcome to my blog :). Please note that nothing on this site is reflective of my employer or anyone other than myself. 

## [](#about-me)About me

I'm a Nigerian man, with dreadlocs. I work as a software engineer and I enjoy playing chess, listening to music, and being in bed. 

## [](#about-this-blog)About this page

I am thinking of this as a journal. I come across a lot of information daily (We all do), and this is where I reflect/share what I find most appealing at time of writing. If anything catches your eyes and you would like to reach me, feel free to text me on whatsapp **(+250788710720)**.
