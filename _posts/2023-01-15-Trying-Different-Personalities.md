title: Trying Different Personalities

I was having a conversation with a mentor at work, and after work-specific discussions, I asked for feedback on my performance. Specifically, I asked, "What could I be doing better?" My mentor thought about this question briefly and gave a positive review, saying I was doing well. However, they went on and noted that one thing I could do was try out different personalities. This response was unique and fascinating, probably because it was the last thing I expected to hear in a professional setting since I was expecting more work-oriented feedback. Maybe something like "resolve bugs faster" or "Pick up more tasks", something that would illustrate a deficit in my current performance. 

I decided to investigate further. What exactly was my current personality, and what other personas could I try? My mentor described my personality as trying to get things done in a correct manner, specifically referencing the fact that I tend to ask for permission execute tasks, which is typically to ensure that I am doing them in the right and correct way. Apparently, this is a persona that is opposed to just executing without guarantee of correctness and letting things break. As we had the conversation, I could not help but laugh because this was a correct assessment! We talked a bit more about this specific to work, and overall, it was a very productive feedback session for me. So I decided to do further investigation outside of work. 

I have always just classified myself as an introvert, generally uninteresting with few friends and hobbies, but now I was curious to learn more about personalities. In my search, I found a lot of psychologists references to the "[big five](https://pages.uoregon.edu/sanjay/bigfive.html#whatisit)" personality traits;

- Extroversion: How sociable a person is. 
- Conscientiousness: This is measured by discipline and level of organization.
- Agreeableness: Referring to a persons warmth and empathy levels.
- Openness: Referring to a persons level of receptiveness to new ideas. 
- Neuroticism: Referring to a persons level of depression and anxiety.

It does seem reasonable to be able to capture a person's personality across these dimensions. On discovering them, I tried to score myself on each of the traits. This scores looked like;   

- Extroversion: 0 - I am very introverted. 
- Conscientiousness: 7.5 - I pride myself in my consistency at the gym amongst other things. 
- Agreeableness: 3 - I love to argue since I have a lot of opinions. 
- Openness: 3 - Because I eat only west African food. 
- Neuroticism: 7.5 - I generally think i'm more cynical than most 

Then I discovered there are tools with questionnaires designed to score personalities across these dimensions. So I took the "[Big five project personality test](https://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/)" as well. This test allows you answer questions relative to someone else (who you ought to know well). I reproduced similar results to my assumptions above (See the [results](https://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/results/?o=44,44,88&c=100,100,94&e=19,50,0&a=25,75,13&n=69,38,69&o2=50,63,44&c2=44,56,44&e2=81,94,100&a2=63,63,69&n2=44,44,31&y=2000&g=m&y2=2000&g2=m)). Though, it is probably a good case of confirmation bias, but the results probably aren't too far from the truth either (I think so I am). 

Now back to the crux of the matter, what personalities do I try? How do I go about mixing up these traits? From my mentor's scenario earlier, I would imagine trying to be less Conscientiousness & Neurotic and more open would be the right mix to get to a point where I care less about "correctness" and focus more on execution without the hindrances of the negative things that could possibly happen. Beyond my work, I also think I could apply this advice to life generally. For instance, to making more friends (which would be lovely), I could try being more agreeable & extroverted. 

To be clear, I don't think trying out different personalities is equal to changing personas (though it could be possible). I do think I would never become a full-blown extrovert (My lack of open mindedness is showing!!!), but I think it is reasonable to try out being an extrovert, almost like a mental game you play for a few hours, then you can go back home and embrace the warm comforts of your blanket with peace and quiet. At the very least, I think this is an essential skill at work so, I will definitely try it out and see what I can get out of different personas. 

This [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/03/how-to-change-your-personality-happiness/621306/) is a very interesting piece with some experience on trying out different personalities as well, in case you are curious about the "how" to go about trying out different personalities.
