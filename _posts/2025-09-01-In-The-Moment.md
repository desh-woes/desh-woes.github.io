title: How it feels in this moment.

I'm writing this so I can laugh at it later. I know how quickly I forget, but there is so much to be said about the *pain of the moment*.

How it grips my heart, putting me in a state so close to being sick. A cold weight that settles deep in my stomach.

And life doesn't dare stop for mere feelings. A calendar reminder for a meeting pops up; messages from friends wait for a reply. But these demands feel like they're behind a thick wall of glass, their urgency muted by the frantic throb in my chest.

Yet, underneath it all, there's a strange clarity. A painful, unwelcome, but undeniable reminder of my own existence.

This is what it feels like to be alive sometimes. In some ways, there's a sense of relief that I can still feel this wayâ€”that this moment, too, is what living feels like.

Okay, let me get back to work. ðŸ«‚
