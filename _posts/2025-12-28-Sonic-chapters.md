title: Sonic Chapters - My Year in Soundtracks

<p class="music-intro">Thanks to Spotify Wrapped, reflecting on our listening habits has become a modern tradition. For me, it feels only right; I tend to live my year in "themes," using music to navigate the specific highs and lows of every moment.</p>

<p class="music-intro">2025 has been a total rollercoaster. To mark the end of it, I wanted to share my heavy rotations alongside a few reflections on the phases this music carried me through. Before we dive into the highlights, here is a look at the data:</p>

<p class="music-intro"><strong>The 2025 Data Points:</strong></p>

<ul class="music-stats">
  <li><strong>Minutes Listened:</strong> 93,461. To be fair, these are rookie numbers for me! But that was intentional. This year, I actively sought out more silence and "unplugged" moments.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Listening Age:</strong> 20. This is a new thing from Spotify that claims to identify the "vibe" of your music through age demographics. Apparently, my soul is stuck in its early twenties.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Club Status:</strong> Leader of Cloud State Society. According to Spotify, this club finds peace in music, and new members should be gifted a house plant.</li>
</ul>

  <p><strong>Larry June:</strong> Lifestyle organic! Larry's music offers a certain "doing things with intention" vibe that matched my goal for a quieter year. Tracks like <span class="music-title">Smoothies in 1991</span>, <span class="music-title">Ocean Sounds</span> and <span class="music-title">Watering My Plants</span> were the soundtrack to my morning routines. I need a trip to San Francisco already! Yes lord 🙏🏾.</p>

  <p><strong>Tim Lyre:</strong> Senpai!! My most played tracks included <span class="music-title">Economy</span>, <span class="music-title">Miles</span>, and <span class="music-title">Rocket Ship</span>. If you haven't heard it, I highly recommend his latest album, <span class="music-title">Spiral</span>. That's a great body of work right there. I also got to see him live in London this year. Peak experience from a peak artist.</p>

  <p><strong>Monaky:</strong> I discovered Monaky randomly at the gym this year, and his unique sound kept me coming back. <span class="music-title">Chandelier</span>, <span class="music-title">The Goat</span>, and <span class="music-title">Beholder</span> stayed on high rotation.</p>

<div class="music-text-card music-reflection">
  <p><strong>Drake:</strong> We love Drake on this side, I fear. His colab project with <span class="music-title">PARTYNEXTDOOR</span> definitely got its fair share of plays. I mostly did full-album sessions this year with Drake, so while no one song dominated, <span class="music-title">PIMMIE'S DILEMMA</span> is an honorable mention.</p>

<div class="music-text-card music-reflection">
  <p><strong>Show Dem Camp:</strong> Palmwine music for every season. Though they released the masterpiece <span class="music-title">AFRIKA MAGIK</span> much later this year, SDC has been on rotation since January. <span class="music-title">Rise Again</span> and <span class="music-title">I'll Wait</span> are my current faves. Whether it's the mellow vibes or the sharp lyricism, they always seem to have a track for whatever mood I'm in.</p>

<div class="music-text-card music-reflection">
  <p><strong><span class="music-title">Our Time Together (The Live Album)</span> - Jacob Banks:</strong> The star that is Jacob Banks. I classify this as soulful R&B; it's the kind of music that gets me reflective and in my feelings. I also got to see him perform live this year in London with a special friend. If there is one song you should hear to assess the vibe, I recommend <span class="music-title">Found</span>.</p>

<div class="music-text-card music-reflection">
  <p><strong><span class="music-title">Boy Alone</span> - Omah Lay:</strong> Omah Lay somehow captures my attention with his voice. When I find myself craving calm, vibey Afrobeats, <span class="music-title">Boy Alone</span> tends to be my go-to. It's beautifully arranged with spicy, relatable lyrics.</p>

  <p><strong><span class="music-title">Between the Lines</span> - TheyCallHimAp:</strong> <span class="music-listen-count">116 Listens</span> I loved the overall flow of the song. The lyrics are a cherry on top as they give an old soulful vibe that speaks to a certain philosophy of living and navigating life.</p>

  <p><strong><span class="music-title">Wrong Places</span> - Joshua Baraka & JAE5:</strong> <span class="music-listen-count">113 Listens</span> I'll pass you the lighter, even if it breaks my heart 😭. I rinsed this song this year on my month-long trip to Rwanda and Nairobi. It was the theme song for that trip and it perfectly captures my head space at the time.</p>

  <p><strong><span class="music-title">O TI J'OBA</span> - Dimeji:</strong> <span class="music-listen-count">92 Listens</span> I love this song. It's kind of an addulation to God becoming a King; an acknowledgment of God as the chief orchestrator of all things. Great vocals and sweet Yoruba.</p>

## Closing Thoughts

<p class="music-intro">This journey back in time has been a fun experience for myself and I am happy to share some of the fun so I have compiled a 20 song playlist of all the songs I have highlighted on here and some bonus ones. I wish I could add a lot more songs but I have tried to highlight some of my faves based on my listening history this year.</p>

<a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/40O1JARsZ3sq1vyIn5h9u9?si=pIQ-8zngTzW8Gwg5sIalTA" class="music-playlist-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">🎵 Listen to the Complete Playlist</a>

<p class="music-intro">I hope I can do this again next year. Who knows what the vibe would be? 😊.</p>
